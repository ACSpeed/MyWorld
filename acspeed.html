					 A BIT ABOUT ME
				</div>
		   		<div id="stuff">
				     I started to learn HTML and CSS when I decided to design a website for an old band I was in and my interest in the field has just grown and grown ever since. I'm looking for an opportunity with a company to develop my skills and experience in HTML and CSS with the chance to learn Javascript, Jquery, C#, PHP and platforms such as MAGENTO, Wordpress, Drupal and also working with API's (Plus loads of other area's).<br><br>
					 My main passions in life are Art, Music and problem solving! I've studied graphic design and fine art along with marketing management and also music technology. I thrive on creativity and love being confused by new things! This gives me an opportuniy to learn something new and to try and solve a problem at the same time.<br><br>
			         Over the last 12 months I have also developed experience with domain hosting, FTP managment, SEO, Analytics, PPC, Social Campaigns and general web design. The following website is a site that I've designed in terms of the layout, content and graphic design, This inclues the product packaging. (Please note: I DID NOT CODE THIS SITE, I JUST DESIGNED IT). <a id="sitelink" href="http://www.themightyburgercompany.co.uk" target="_blank">Take A Look!</a>
					 Thanks for taking the time to check out my site and info, If you think you may be able to offer me a suitable position then feel free to get in touch.<br><br>AC Speed
